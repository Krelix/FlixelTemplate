========================================================
				A simple Flixel template
========================================================

Created using Flash Develop on Windows.
Requires downloading flixel and adding the src folder
to the classpath of the project.
Based (heavily) on Photonstorm's Flashdevelop tutorial.
Using DAME editor to generate the CSV (*url*)
And Paint.NET to create the sprites.
